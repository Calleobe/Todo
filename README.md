Project by Carl Ã–berg and Fabio Cassisa

## The problem

We made a simple to-do app with the use of React and Redux toolkit. Since we were very short on time this week we focused on a MVP. We were interested to explore styled components and implemented that into the assignment. We wanted direct our focus on the final project instead. So for sure the basic requirements have been met for a G, we will try to implement for more, but not aim for it.
